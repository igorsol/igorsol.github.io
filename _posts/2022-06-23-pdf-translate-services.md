# Issue

One day I need to translate big enough PDF file into English. The task is even
harder because original document had rich formatting.

# Investigation

I thought to do translation manually, something like:

- load original document into Google docs
- convert PDF to Google docs format and open it for editing (this is possible)
- translate sentences one by one and try to preserve formatting
- apply some formatting (but obviously it is pretty hard to achieve exactly same
  format as in original document)
- then convert Gdocs document back to PDF

It is doable but I started thinking about magic online service to translate
whole PDF.

# Solution

[Quick search](https://www.google.com/search?q=translate+pdf+to+english) provided several links to online PDF translation services.

- [https://products.aspose.app/words/translator](https://products.aspose.app/words/translator)
- [https://products.groupdocs.app/translation/pdf/](https://products.groupdocs.app/translation/pdf/)
- [https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/translationform](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/translationform) 

I don't remember which one I used to translate my documents but result
was so good that I didn't change any word in the result PDF.
